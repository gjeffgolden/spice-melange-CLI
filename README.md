DUNE quotes:

“I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”

“The proximity of a desirable thing tempts one to overindulgence. On that path lies danger.”

“You see, my climate demands a special attitude towards water. You are aware of water at all times. You waste nothing that contains moisture.”

“The universe is full of doors.”

“Deep in the human unconscious is a pervasive need for a logical universe that makes sense, But the real universe is always one step beyond logic.”

“The mystery of life isn’t a problem to solve, but a reality to experience.”

“Intelligence takes chance with limited data in an arena where mistakes are not only possible but also necessary.”

“A process cannot be understood by stopping it. Understanding must move with the flow of the process, must join it and flow with it.”
